# OpportuNest: A Web App to Manage Internships at ENSMR and to connect students with alumni through posting internships offers and contacts information
OpportuNest is an academic project that was developed to enhance the traditional internships platform through more tracking features for users and equip it with new features
to create a private network for students and graduates at ENSMR in that same platform.
It offers basic features to submit information and documents related to students internships, track requests and have more details on their status that should be provided by
the internships service.
Type of users are: students, graduates and the internships service. Each type has its own set of actions to perform on the app and all accounts are created by the administration and delivered to users without signing up option.

The project has got a few remaining parts that are still under developement.
